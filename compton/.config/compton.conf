# Basic compton config with fade transition and shadows

# Drop shadows
# If you use this config with i3-gaps, compton will draw shadows on title bars. This is because 
# i3 creates title bars as windows. I've only been able to circumvent this by removing title bars 
# completely - see my i3 config files.

# Fading transitions
